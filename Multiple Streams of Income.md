# Multiple Streams of Income

Multiple streams of income just acknowledges that we live in an uncertain world, 
and depending on a single stream of income is risky. So people might try and
generate multiple streams of income to reduce their risk. Some possibilities:

1. Social Security
2. Pension
3. Rental income
4. Dividend income from stock ETFs like VYM
5. Dividend income from bond ETFs like BND
6. Working part-time in retirement to generate some wage-based income
