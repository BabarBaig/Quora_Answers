# Multiple Streams of Income

Generating multiple streams of income just acknowledges that we live in an uncertain
world.  Depending on a single stream of income is risky.  So it's a good idea to try
and generate multiple streams of income to reduce risk.

Some possibilities:

1. Social Security
2. Pension
3. Rental income
4. Dividend income from stock ETFs like VYM
5. Dividend income from bond ETFs like BND
6. Working part-time in retirement to generate some wage-based income
